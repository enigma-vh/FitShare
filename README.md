# FitShare
FitShare is a social Fitness-Nutrition mobile application written in Kotlin and connected with a MongoDB Realm backend. This application is my senior group project, where I worked with four other teammates. The developing process took around eight months, whereas brainstorming, planning, and setting up our backend took the first two months. There were a lot of arguments, conflicts, and difficulties, but fortunately, we made it!!! We had the opportunity to represent our class in the Senior Expo 2022 and was honored as one of the "Most socially impactful application."

Feel free to fork or download this project so you could try it out and use this code as a foundation to create your own social app :grin:.
