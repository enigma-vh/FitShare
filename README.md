# FitShare
FitShare is a social Fitness-Nutrition mobile application written in Kotlin and connected with a MongoDB Realm backend. This is my senior group project, where I worked with four other teammates. The devloping process actually took around 8 months, where the first 2 months is for brainstorming, planning, and setting up our backend. There were a lot of arguments, conflicts, and difficulties; but foruntately, we make it!!! We had the opportunity to represent our class in the Senior Expo 2022, and was honored as oen of the "Most socially impactful application".

Feel free to fork or download this project so you could try it out and use this code as a foundation to create your own social app :grin:.
